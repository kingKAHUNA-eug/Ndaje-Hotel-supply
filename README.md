# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) (or [oxc](https://oxc.rs) when used in [rolldown-vite](https://vite.dev/guide/rolldown)) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh

## React Compiler

The React Compiler is not enabled on this template because of its impact on dev & build performances. To add it, see [this documentation](https://react.dev/learn/react-compiler/installation).

## Expanding the ESLint configuration

If you are developing a production application, we recommend using TypeScript with type-aware lint rules enabled. Check out the [TS template](https://github.com/vitejs/vite/tree/main/packages/create-vite/template-react-ts) for information on how to integrate TypeScript and [`typescript-eslint`](https://typescript-eslint.io) in your project.



## make an admin dashboard which shows graphics such as graphs,charts and the system history[insert test credentials to only direct theadmin to this dashboard]
## make a manager dashboard [insert test credentials to only direct the manager to this dashboard]
## N.B on the manager dashboard there requests from the clients in which the manager must approve such as payment,assigning a given requets to the driver through there mobile phone,tracking the deliveries,make the whole process report
## make also a research on quote based system in which the clients will make order through and this order will be directed to the managers where a manager will have to choose to respond to a requsts of the client within their dashboard
## N.B the managers may be more than one and choose to respond to a certain request so the system must take one of them to work on it depending on the one who chose to do it first and others must wait for other requests
## make the ClientLanding responsive by replacing the it with an image that is located in scr/assets/images/backgroungImage.png
